## Offensive Security Certified Professional

### Background  

The OSCP, one of the most well known certifications in the field of penetration testing. Many would say it is the de facto entry level penetration testing certification. I on the other hand do not think it is an entry level IT certification. There is considerable background knowledge to learn so one may comprehend the courseware. Now, I'm not saying you need to be a fully fledged programmer, or a senior systems administrator. However, knowing your way around a network and a command line will benefit you greatly. 

### The Course
Putting the certification itself aside, lets talk about the course: the PEN-200(formally known as Penetration Testing with Kali Linux(PWK)). In my opinion, this course will teach you everything needed to pass the exam, and obtain the OSCP Certification. Looking at the course info page, we learn a few things:  

- Benefits
    - Introduction into the latest hacking tools and techniques
    - Training from the experts behind Kali Linux
    - Learn the “Try Harder” method and mindset
    - Earn the industry-leading OSCP certification
- Who is the course for?
	- Infosec professionals transitioning into penetration testing
	- Pentesters seeking an industry-leading certification
	- Security professionals
	- Network administrators
	- Other technology professionals
- Course Prerequisites
	- Solid understanding of TCP/IP networking    
	- Reasonable Windows and Linux administration experience
	- Familiarity with basic Bash and/or Python scripting

To compare those with my experience, I would say that PEN-200 does 4/4 of the benefits. I learned more about the latest tools and techniques, and the course ware ties in nicely with the Kali Linux OS. I've learned what it means to "Try Harder", and I earned my OSCP. Similar to 'Who is the course for?', I've been working in the security industry for just shy of three years, and obtained a 4 year degree in information system a few years prior. In between the two, I worked on a helpdesk while dipping my toes into any network admin or system admin tickets as much as they would let me. Lastly for the prerequisites, I would say that those are good suggestions, but don't know if the last one is really needed. I would say I went into the course with a very minimal amount of Bash and Python scripting experience and learned enough during the course.   

Since penetration testing is mostly 'hands on keyboard' work, the courseware comes with a shared lab to learn and practice your techniques. This lab is shared with an undisclosed amount of students. Maybe I lucked out, but out of the 55 lab hosts I owned, I rarely ran into another student, or got my machine randomly reset. I feel like that is not the norm, and thus wanted to mention this. Besides the shared lab aspect, every machine within the lab is meant to teach you something. I've read and seen a lot of people go into the lab and try to compromise every machine on their own (which is fine, but not what I planned to do). After spending a week on most of the courseware, I decided to hop into the labs. To quote IppSec "I started off with an Nmap scan", found a few hosts that appeared to have some pretty easy vulnerabilities to exploit, and went from there.    

What I found helpful was when I got stuck on something for more than 2 or 3 hours, I would go to the forums and look for some hints. Someone once said "You don't know what you don't know" and that was very applicable here. Whenever I looked at the forums, the process changed from trying to compromise the box, to understanding what I missed and how I could incorporate that into my methodology. I think this was the key that helped me learn so much in so little time.  

### The Exam
Lastly is the exam itself. I purchased 60 days of lab time, and after compromising 55 of the hosts and completing all of the exercises in about 30 days, I felt very prepared. I remember it being 3ish p.m. on a Thursday and I saw that there was an exam slot for the following Saturday at 11a.m. I signed up, and then immediately got anxious about my decision. Friday was a pretty slow day at work(thankfully), so I made sure to prep my notes between meetings and my todo list. After work I did a practice BOF to make sure I still knew it, clocked in at around 30 minutes, and felt prepared. I relaxed the rest of the night, and made some tea to ensure a good nights sleep.

### My exam experience
The following morning my exam started without a hitch, and by lunch time I owned the BOF machine. I took a short break to snack on some leftover chicken tenders. I got back and quickly owned the 10 pointer so I was feeling good. Next, I wanted to work on the 25 pointer as it was still early afternoon, and I wasn't tired yet. I had obtained low level access by dinner time, so I took a break and ate some dinner(shout out to my SO who brought me spaghetti & meatballs. She's the real MVP dealing with me during my lab time). I came back, and after longer than I wanted, I obtained full access. At this point I was sitting at 60 points(65 if you count my report) so I wasn't done yet, but it was getting kind of late. I looked at both of the remaining 20 pointers, found some things and made some notes, but did not make any progress. I kept making silly mistakes, so by 11pm I decided to call it a night and get some sleep.

Day 2, I got up around 6a.m. and took care of the puppy while making some coffee and a quick snack. I had until 10:45a.m. which gave me 4 hours to obtain at least low level access, which would put me at 70 points. I went over all my notes from last night, saw some mistakes, but even with a rested mind, I didn't make any progress. At about 2 hours remaining I reminded myself that it's okay if I fail, it's a learning process after all, but I wanted to pass. I ended up moving my notes to a backup folder and redoing them from scratch in case I missed something. That probably wasn't the best idea, because bouncing between attacking two machines with a clock that's slowly ticking down is anxiety producing. After a while, and a lot of mistakes that I attribute to anxiety, I finally obtained low level access. I obtained this access at around 10a.m., 45 minutes before the end of my exam. Luckily, it took me only a few minutes to bump that up to full access, and own one of the 20 pointers. At this point I had about 30 minutes to make sure all my notes and screenshots were update## Offensive Security Certified Professional

At this point I had about 30 minutes to make sure all my notes and screenshots were updated, but as someone who reports as they go(thanks everyone for this suggestion), it wasn't that difficult. I thanked my proctor(s), closed the exam with 5 minutes to spare, and then took the puppy on a walk. I spent the evening touching up my report and sent it in that night. By Wednesday I got an email saying that I had passed and earned my OSCP.

### Summary
Overall this course/exam was a blast, not only did I learn a lot, but who doesn't like popping shells all day.  I'm currently not a pentester at my $dayjob, but that is hopefully going to change soon. Putting all that aside, I think this is a great course for anyone in the information security field. Whether you're on the blue side, the red side, the GRC side, the IR side, etc, this course can teach you a ton. With this course in the rear view, I'm looking to move to the pentest side of the field, and then sign up for either the CRTP or OSEP. More to come!d, but as someone who reports as they go(thanks everyone for this suggestion), it wasn't that difficult.
