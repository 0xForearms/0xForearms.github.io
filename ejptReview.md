## eLearnSecurity Junior Penetration Tester Review  

# Background
eLearnSecurity/INE Junior Penetration Tester(eJPT) is their intro level course for penetration testing.  This course/exam covers all the basics of penetration testing and offers a good intro into the field.  I don't believe this course is enough to land a pentesting job as it barely scratches the surface of this field, but it's a good intro if Hack the Box(HTB) seems to daunting.  TryHackMe on the other hand probably is probably at the same level as this course in terms of difficulty.  With the INE merger/takeover you can now get the courses for free by signing up for their starter pass.  

Some of the prerequisites mentioned on their site:
  - Deep understanding of network concepts
  - Simple manual web application security assessment and exploitation
  - Basic vulnerability assessment of networks
  - Using Metasploit for performing simple attacks
  - Web application manual exploitation through attack vectors
  - Ability to perform protocol analysis of traffic capture
  - Understanding of information gathering techniques
  - Understanding of the penetration testing process
  
To expand on some of their prereqs, I personally had a decent understanding of network concepts as well as security related concepts, but I only had my random knowledge gained from various HTB machines.  If you don't have these prereqs, I would still recommend checking the course out, especially now since it's free.

According to eLearn's site, after obtaining your eJTP, you should have decent knowledge of:
  - TCP/IP
  - IP Routing
  - LAN protocols and devices
  - HTTP and web technologies
  - Essential penetration testing processes and methodologies
  - Basic vulnerability assessment of networks
  - Basic vulnerability assessment of web applications
  - Exploitation with Metasploit
  - Simple web application manual exploitation
  - Basic information gathering and reconnaissance
  - Simple scanning and profiling of the target
  
It seems as if there is quite a few things that this course covers, however I wanted to mention a lot of these topics are coverd at a really high level.  For example, the HTTP and web technologies, is such a broad topic, it would be impossible to cover everything you need in a junior level course.  However the course does well at teaching basic concepts and preparing you for their certification exam.

# Labs
I can't comment on the INE labs for the eJPT, I took it when it was the HERA labs on eLS's platform and I can't say I have any complaints.  The labs spun up quickly and I don't recall having any issues with the labs not working as expected.  I didn't have access to the blackbox labs as the version I bought didn't come with all the extras(which are now included in the starter pass).

# Exam  
The exam was a 72 hour, 20 multiple choice exam regarding aspects of a black box penetration test.  In order to pass you have to get 15/20 questions correct.  I believe I passed with 17 out of the 20, but I can't remember exactly.  I recall all of the questions being straightforward and didn't leave anything up to interpretation that some other exams do(Looking at you Sec+).  If you're able to do the labs on your own, then the exam will be a piece of cake.  Without breaking the NDA, it's essentially a more complex lab.  You will probably use aspects from every topic you learned in the course, as well as some additional topics that you might have to research on your own. From what other people have said, you probably can find everything you need within the course work, but at the time of the exam, I used google a quite a bit.

# Conclusion
Now that the course is free to take via INE's starter pass, I think this is a no brainer for people trying to break into the pentest field.  The exam on the other hand, since there isn't much recognition in the field, one could probably skip that and put the money towards the OSCP or even the eLearnSecurity Professional Penetration Tester Certification.
