Penetration Tester, forever trying to not be a skid.

Hello there! Welcome to my Github.io Page.  

This is just meant to be a simple page explaining some of the work, projects, and other assorted accomplishments I’ve completed over the years.  I'm currently a penetration tester at a security company.  Prior to that I worked as a bench technician, and eventually a service desk technitian at a regional financial institution.  During this time I finished my B.S. degree in Information Systems and started my lifelong journey to learn as much about computer security as I possibly could.  After graduating I had an opportunity to internally pivot from the service desk to a security analyst focusing on GRC work.

In my free time I’m an avid CTF player as well as HTB, THM, and VulnHub participant. Formerly known as WatIsYourPasswd.
