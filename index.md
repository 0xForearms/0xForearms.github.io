Aspiring Penetration Tester

Hello there! Welcome to my Github.io Page.  

This is just meant to be a simple page explaining some of the work, projects, and other assorted accomplishments I’ve completed over the years.  Now a little bit about myself, I currently work on the security team as a GRC analyst overseeing the companies external audits, third party vendor requests, and other assorted tasks.  Prior to that I worked in various technician roles starting as an bench technician fixing people’s computers at a local shop to practically a sysadmin, working on various tasks related to a companies infrastructure.  During this time I finished my B.S. degree in Information Systems and started my lifelong journey to learn as much about computer security as I possibly could.  

In my free time I’m an avid CTF player as well as HTB, THM, and VulnHub participant. I choose this pseudonym because I've used Linux as an operating system for close to 10 years now and the importance of the /etc/passwd file in security(Unfortunately no one has DM'd me their password yet).
